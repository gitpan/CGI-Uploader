Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Uploader.

0.75_02
	- Refactored delete_upload() to be simpler and more intuitive.

0.75_01
	- Added support for specifying fields to process via regular expressions. 
	- Improved Cookbook documentation. 

0.70_02 Wed Apr 21, 2004
    - Removed custom_meta(). This problem space is now addressed by 
      allowing meta data to be passed to store_uploads(). Also, you could
      override extract_meta() to add more functionality there.
    - Added support for storing files based on a MD5 sum of the files 
      ID. This allows the file storage to scale well for millions of uploads.
      See the docs for 'file_scheme' for detaills. (Thanks to Randal Schwartz
      for the suggestion). 
    - Added option to specify only a max width or max height for thumbnails.
    - Refactored several interfaces to use named parameters. 
    - Added 'downsize' option to spec, allowing downsizing of primary images.

0.70_01
    - Added to binmode() calls to file handles, to possibly help Windows.
	- Added support for uploading via CGI::Simple
	- Added experimental support for uploading via Apache::Request
	- Added Cookbook documentation
	- Added 'thumbnail_of_id' column to meta data table.
    - Added delete_thumbs() method
    - Started to do real 'updates' rather than delete/re-inserts
	- Cleaned up prequisites in Makefile.PL
	- Fixed bug and added test for proper thumbnail resizing
    - More API refactors

0.63_01
    - Removed some un-needed mentions of Data::FormValidator from tests
    - added test to verify thumbnail size
    - refactored resize code into gen_thumb(). This will make it easier 
      to support other resize modules besides Image::Magick. 
    - Added Image::Size as a dependency. It's a fast tool for size checking
      which does not depend on a graphics module being installed. 
    - Initial support for resizing with GD as a backup. It needs tested. 

0.62_01
    - Added File::Temp to Makefile.PL. 
    - Refactored to remove store_thumb(). This should help eventually support other
      graphics modules besides Image::Magick

0.61_02
    - Minor POD cleanups

0.61_01
    - Added custom_meta() method for more flexible meta data handled
    - clarified code and extended documentation
    - exposed 'build_loc' function, which may be useful as a utility function,
      or for a sub-class.
    - custom fields are now returned with meta_hashref() 

0.60_02
    - Added up_table_map test and fixed some related code.

0.60_01
    - Added 'up_table_map' configuration option, allowing for custom column
      names.
    - Documentation for several functions added.
    - Began refactoring to make support for Apache::Request easier.  

0.50_03 Mon Mar 22, 2004
    - possible "binmode" test fix for Windows platforms.

0.50_02 Sun Mar 21, 2004
    - Removed dependence on Image::Size 
    - Documentation clarifications (David Manura)

0.50_01 Web Feb 11, 2004
    - Removed dependence on Data::FormValidator

0.40_01 Sun Feb 8, 2004
    - Extensive documentation updates, thanks to feedback from David Manura.

0.30_01 Fri Feb 6, 2004 
    - The API was largely re-worked, with several methods renamed and a few
      added. No backwards compatibility can be expected. 

0.10  
	[THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
	- create_img_tmpl_vars() has been replaced
	  with a more generic create_tmpl_vars(). 
	  It should still work the same for images,
	  and better for non-images

	- install_uploads() Now returns a hash ref 
	based on the valid hash, with appropriate additions
	and deletions already made.

    - The interface for delete_upload() has changed to accomodate
	deleting based on directly providing a upload ID.

0.02  Sun May 18 2003

0.01  Sat May 17 16:15:05 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-b 5.5.0 -XAn CGI::Uploader
