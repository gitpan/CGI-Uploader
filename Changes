0.10  
	[THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
	- create_img_tmpl_vars() has been replaced
	  with a more generic create_tmpl_vars(). 
	  It should still work the same for images,
	  and better for non-images

	- install_uploads() Now returns a hash ref 
	based on the valid hash, with appropriate additions
	and deletions already made.

    - The interface for delete_upload() has changed to accomodate
	deleting based on directly providing a upload ID.
